## How can I help?

You may book me for the following services:

- taking photos for people,
- ordaining a wedding,
- reviewing software code and system designs,
- giving mock interviews for programming roles,
- editing your writings, and
- walking with you if you are too afraid to go somewhere alone.

Let's talk. Our first 30-min consultation will be free.
